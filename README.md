This program has been implemented for char and unsigned char. 

The first two functions convert the string input to an integer while checking the datatype range.
The following function converts the decimal (base 10) value to binary numbers.
Conversion is done by allocating a char pointer for the results and using shift bits.
Lastly, the check functions compare the result output and the expected output. 
This function also frees the malloc done during the conversion function.

The test functions are created to check four different areas;
1 - Convert string function.
2 - Check the number format.
3 - Range check.
4 - Binary conversion.
